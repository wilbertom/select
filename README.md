CSS selector engine for the future.

This is a project for me to learn parsing, CSS, and Rust. I doubt it will ever
be a real project.


Wish list
=====

These things should be implemented in the future:

1. Group selectors.
2. Built in HTML parser implementing `Selectable`.
3. Examples of usage outside of querying HTML.
